This was a very fun project for me. I took a few mini projects and tied them all into one.   
<ul>
<li>Weather API</li>
<li>Clock with Date and current time</li>
<li>Google Search Bar</li>
<li>To-Do List</li>
<li>Music Station</li>
<li>Calendar</li>
<li>Quote Generator</li>
<li>Random Background on each Load</li>
</ul>
